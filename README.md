# Perceptron-Algorithm
The given program implements perceptron algorithm on a 2d space. <br />
The points given are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) <br />
the expected output after doing logical OR operaion is <br />
(0,0) -> 0 <br />
(0,1) -> 1 <br />
(1,0) -> 1 <br />
(1,1) -> 1 <br />
The outputs can be seen as 2 different classes (0 and 1) <br />
