# Perceptron-Algorithm
The given program implements perceptron algorithm on a 2d space. <br />
Steps to run : <br />
1. cd perceptron <br />
2. python generate_data.py <br />
3. python perceptron.py <br />
4. python test.py <br /><br />
An easier implementation of perceptron can be seen in Logical Functions. <br />
The Logical OR perceptron is an implementation of OR operation on binary digital data.<br />
The points given are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) <br />
the expected output after doing logical OR operaion is <br />
(0,0) -> 0 <br />
(0,1) -> 1 <br />
(1,0) -> 1 <br />
(1,1) -> 1 <br />
The outputs can be seen as 2 different classes (0 and 1) <br />
Pipreqs file present for numpy and matplotlib and other libraries necessary  <br />
Intructions to use requirements.txt file : <br />
run python -m pip install -r requirements.txt <br />
or pip install -r requirements.txt <br /> <br />
